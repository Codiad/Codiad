# Codiad Web IDE

Codiad is a web-based IDE framework with a small footprint and minimal requirements. 

Codiad was built with simplicity in mind, allowing for fast, interactive development without the massive overhead of some of the larger desktop editors. That being said even users of IDE's such as Eclipse, NetBeans and Aptana are finding Codiad's simplicity to be a huge benefit. While simplicity was key, we didn't skimp on features and have a team of dedicated developer actively adding more.

## Todo
issues: with PHP 7.2 introducing md_* function as php functions
-> first todo: add a prefix to codiad functions (i.e.: function co_mb_chr() )

## Unmaintained Status

Given its age and number of viable alternatives now available, Codiad is no longer under active maintenance by core contributors. You may use the [issues](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/issues) for seeking community help on any ongoing issues, however, the code maintained in this repository is unlikely to be updated.
